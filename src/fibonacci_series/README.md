Problem: Given a positive integer n, find the Fibonacci value at nth step.

For example, Fibonacci series would be of this form -
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....

where the value at step n is the sum of value at (n - 1) and (n -2) respectively.

Fibonacci(n = 3) = 2
Fibonacci(n = 5) = 5
Fibonacci(n = 7) = 13
